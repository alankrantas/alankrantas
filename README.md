### Alan Wang ðŸ‘‹ Technical Marketing Writer

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Alan *Wong* (krantas is just a fun name dated from my early social media era).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on FST Network's [LOC documentation](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/) and [marketing blog](https://www.fst.network/blog).
- ðŸŒ± Learning bits and pieces of software technologies sometimes simlpy out of curiosity: frontend frameworks, machine learning, embedding programming, Kubernetes and Githib Actions, etc.
- ðŸ¤” Write three other blogs although not too regulary: [personal](https://krantasblog.blogspot.com/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@alankrantas) | [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been a profession translator twice as longer than as a developer. Have translated works by Alice Munro, John le CarrÃ© and George R. R. Martin. Also: I hate Java and poorly-written docs.
- ðŸ‘¯ Loves novels, movies, music and [film photography](https://www.pexels.com/@alan-wang-207740683/). Do Maker projects very occasionally.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything (although I may not be able to answer) unless you are rude or have proved youself super-lazy in problem solving.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: krantas@gmail.com (personal) | alan.wang@fstk.io (work).
