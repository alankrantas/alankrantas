# Investigations and Speculation About Companies I've Encountered

## Who Owns EBC Financial Group?

**EBC Financial Group (UK) Ltd.** is a limited company registered in England and wales under Company number 12503674.

In its UK registration, its "Persons with significant control" was one **Mr Qin Huazheng** from Hong Kong (Mar 2020), before "switching" to a company **Ideale Capital Limited** from Cayman Islands (Apr 2021).

Huazheng Qin had published at least two papers: "Self-Adaptive Cloud Pricing Strategies with Markov Prediction and Data Mining Method" (2012) and "A Graph-based Recommendation across Heterogeneous Domains" (2015).

Qin is also the director of **EBC Tech LTD.** or **EBC Tech Limited**. (May 2020, CR No. 2944304), located in Hong Kong, which describes itself as "a technology enterprise specializing in application software customization development and data mining."

EBC Tech LTD.'s website shares a similar logo to EBC Financial Group on its website, and the Forex trading speed is indeed one of the obvious strong suit of the latter. Very possible that EBC Tech Limited built the Forex system used by EBC Financial Group.

Interestingly, a lof of press releases (with multiple Asian language versions) from EBC Financial Group - especially on EIN Presswire - include a line states **"NEWS PROVIDED BY EBC Tech Limited"**.

In some of the press releases, one Douglas Chew, the Global Public Relations Lead, also have contact information as follows (with a Chinese-based email address and a Malaysia-based phone number):

```
Douglas Chew
EBC Tech Limited
+ +60 11-3196 6887

```

From their marketing channels, the majority of EBC Financial Group's physical events were mostly held in Asia (China, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.), with the CEO David Barrett often fly to Asia to talk at events or to local press, but very little elsewhere.

It seems to me that EBC Financial Group, despite washing its origin to UK, is under a strong influence from EBC Tech LTD. and thus very possibly controlled by Chinese-based owners.

## Who Owns Tibbo Technology Inc.?

The IoT company, **Tibbo Technology Inc.**, has its headquarter and factories in New Taipei City, Taiwan.

However many important members of this company and **Tibbo Systems** (a closely related company) are clearly Russians:

- Dmitry Slepov - Managing Director and Co-Founder (who owns ~74% shares of the Taiwanese company)
- Victor Polyakov - CEO 
- Mikhail Kim - CTO
- Olga Micallef - Commercial Director
- Olga Osipova - CFO
- Natalia Lipovskaya - Marketing Director
- Oksana Shologon - HR
- Sergey Likharev - Sales Director

And it seems both Tibbos' solutions are based on **AggreGate**, a Russian IoT company operating mostly in Russian domestic market.

So Tibbo Technology Inc. is in fact a Russian company washing its origin to Taiwan, possibly to avoid sanctions.
