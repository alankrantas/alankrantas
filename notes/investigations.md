# Investigations and Speculation About Companies I've Encountered

## Who Owns EBC Financial Group?

**EBC Financial Group (UK) Ltd.** described itself as a limited company registered in England and Wales under company number 12503674.

In its UK registration, its "Persons with significant control" was one **Mr Qin Huazheng** from Hong Kong (Mar 2020), before "switching" to a company **Ideale Capital Limited** from Cayman Islands (Apr 2021).

Qin's correspondence address is the same as EBC UK. It's not clear that if Qun remains a person with significant control directly over EBC UK.

Huazheng Qin had published at least two papers:
- "Self-Adaptive Cloud Pricing Strategies with Markov Prediction and Data Mining Method" (2012)
- "A Graph-based Recommendation across Heterogeneous Domains" (2015)

Qin is also the director of **EBC Tech LTD.** or **EBC Tech Limited**. (May 2020, CR No. 2944304), located in Hong Kong, which describes itself as "a technology enterprise specializing in application software customization development and data mining". The website logo is the same style as EBC Financial Group.

Interestingly, a lof of press releases from EBC Financial Group on EIN Presswire include a line states **"NEWS PROVIDED BY EBC Tech Limited"**, for example:

```
EBC Financial Group Highlights the Transformative Role of AI in Global Trading and Thailand's Economic Landscape

News Provided By
EBC Tech Limited
March 11, 2025, 08:26 GMT
```

From Feb 2024 to the end of Mar 2025, there were 824 press releases provided by EBC Tech Limited on EIN Presswire, including multiple language versions for the same content. 

In some of the press releases, one Douglas Chew, the Global Public Relations Lead, had contact information as follows, with a Chinese-based email address and a Malaysia-based phone number:

```
Douglas Chew
EBC Tech Limited
+ +60 11-3196 6887
mkt.cn@ebc.com
```

From their marketing channels, the majority of EBC Financial Group's physical events that had been videoed were mostly held in Asia (China, Taiwan, Thailand, Malaysia, etc.), with the CEO David Barrett often fly to Asia to talk at events or to local press, but very little elsewhere.

It seems to me that EBC Financial Group, despite washing its origin to UK, is under strong influence from EBC Tech LTD. and thus very possibly controlled by Chinese-based owners.

## Who Owns Tibbo Technology Inc.?

The IoT company, **Tibbo Technology Inc.**, has its headquarter in New Taipei City, Taiwan, and has factories in other locations in Taiwan.

However, the company (registered as 集博股份有限公司 locally) is controlled by one Dmitry Slepov from St. Petersburg, Managing Director and Co-Founder, who owns ~74% shares of the company.

Tibbo Technology Inc. has a closely related sister company named **Tibbo Systems** based in Tver, Russia (described as "two main members of the (Tibbo) group") that sells a IoT platform named AggreGate. Many high-level members of Tibbo Systems are Russians:

- Victor Polyakov - CEO 
- Mikhail Kim - CTO
- Olga Micallef - Commercial Director
- Olga Osipova - CFO
- Natalia Lipovskaya - Marketing Director
- Oksana Shologon - HR
- Sergey Likharev - Sales Director
- ...and others.

Judging from their social media activities - half of the posts were Russian - Tibbo Systems seems to be operating primary in Russian domestic market.

So both Tibbo Technology and Tibbo Systems are Russian companies, with Tibbo Technology washing its origin to Taiwan possibly to avoid sanctions in relation to the Russian-Ukraine War and/or US chip ban to China.
