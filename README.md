### Alan Wang 👋 Technical Marketing Writer

- 😄 Pronouns: Alan *Wong*. (krantas is just a fun made-up name dated from my very early social media era.)

- 🔭 Currently working on FST Network's [LOC documentation](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/) and [marketing blog](https://www.fst.network/blog).

- 🌱 Learning bits and pieces of software technologies, sometimes simlpy out of curiosity: frontend frameworks, machine learning, embedding programming, cloud and Github stuff, etc.

- 📝 Write three other blogs (although not too regulary): [personal](https://krantasblog.blogspot.com/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@alankrantas) | [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/alankrantas).

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a profession book translator twice as longer than as a developer and had learned amatuer classical piano for almost two decades.

- 👨‍💻 Contributed a few drivers for MakeCode (micro:bit), TinyGo and MicroPython.

- 🤔 Loves novels, movies, music, PC games and [film photography](https://www.pexels.com/@alan-wang-207740683/). Do Maker projects very occasionally.

- 💬 You are welcome to ask anything (about software) unless you have proved youself rude or staggeringly lazy in problem-solving.

- 📫 How to reach me: krantas@gmail.com (personal) | alan.wang@fstk.io (work) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krantas/).
