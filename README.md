### Alan Wang 👋 Technical Marketing Writer

- 😄 Pronouns: Alan *Wong* (krantas is just a fun name dated from my very early social media era).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on FST Network's [LOC documentation](https://documentation.loc.fst.network/) and [marketing blog](https://www.fst.network/blog).

- 🌱 Learning bits and pieces of software technologies sometimes simlpy out of curiosity: frontend frameworks, machine learning, embedding programming, Docker/Kubernetes and Githib stuff, etc.

- 🤔 Write three other blogs (although not too regulary): [personal](https://krantasblog.blogspot.com/) | [Medium](https://medium.com/@alankrantas) | [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/).

- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a profession book translator twice as longer than as a developer because I hated my first job as a Java developer so much.

- 👯 Loves novels, movies, music, PC games and [film photography](https://www.pexels.com/@alan-wang-207740683/). Do Maker projects very occasionally.

- 💬 Ask me about anything (although I may not be able to answer) unless you are rude or have proved youself super-lazy in problem solving.

- 📫 How to reach me: krantas@gmail.com (personal) | alan.wang@fstk.io (work) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krantas/).
