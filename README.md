### Why Does It Matter?

_Why do I even need a human writer_, you ask? Why not AI?

Generative AIs are useful for general writing; however by design they are trained to write like an _average_ person with fixed knowledge. They cannot reason well in your specific domain without lengthy, detailed prompts, and tend to be unimaginative and repetitive due to the lack of input. However, creating reference materials for AI in the first place can be just as challenging.

Quality writing is an art of storytelling, which involves careful researching and organizing around the domain, subject and context, while the creation process is often intuitive, dynamic and nonlinear, much like painting a picture aesthetically, instead of predicting words sequentially. A good article "feels right" because that's what it should be.

As for translating, a competent translator plays a reliable bridge connecting two worlds containing incompatible cultural concepts and ways of speaking. No languages can be converted _word-by-word_ to another, and only one with sufficient understanding can find you the balanced path of readability and faithfulness for readers.

Are you looking for someone who can give your business an edge via content differentiation and better user engagement? Are you having trouble with content quality using ChatGPT or alike? Do you believe that genuine content _matters_? If so, I may be the one to help you to get there.
