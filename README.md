# Alan Wang ✍️

> `Freelance Writer`, `Copywriter` & `Translator`

A seasoned writer with 10+ years of writing and translating backgrounds that have resulted in 50+ full-length [published works](https://github.com/alankrantas/alankrantas/blob/main/works/published.md), dozens of articles and several [writing projects](https://github.com/alankrantas/alankrantas/blob/main/works/projects.md), and has professional experience in technical writing (including documentation), copywriting, content marketing, publishing, software engineering and STEM education.

Quick to learn and eager for challenges, I deliver insightful, high-quality text content for any target audience with precision, care and passion.

_Note: I do not offer AI training writing nor i18n-type semi-machine translating._
